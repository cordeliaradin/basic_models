basic statistical models

the datasets for the titanic were sourced from kaggle and can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

code for models are in both r and python, with some basic exploratory analysis and necessary preproccessing along the way

linear regression to fill in the missing ages in the datasets

logistic regression to predict individual survivability of the event

also i love rmd sorry if its annoying to read
